    <h2>EasySmart Care</h2>
    <p>Easy Smartcare allows Healthcare Organizations (Clinics/Hospitals/Doctors' Practices) to communicate with patients through their mobile phone/PDA/Internet/text messages. It      is a solution for providing two-way communication between caregiver and patient. This provides
    end-to-end patient care from before the visit and through the healing process after the treatment when they have left the medical practice.</p>
    <p>The software provides better preparation, decreased absenteeism,
    medication reminders and monitoring for the patient and improved
    outpatient management.</p>
    <h2><a href="http://sandbox.easymedmobile.com:8080/healthpassport/index.jsp" title="">International Health Passport</a></h2>
    <p>This
    is an Online Personal Health Record (PHR) created in minutes by you
    or your doctor. It gives patients secure access to their medical
    history anytime 365 days a year through their mobile phone/PDA or the
    Internet. This gives patients peace of mind wherever they are in the
    world.</p>
    <h2>Disease Management Software</h2>
    <p>EasyMed provides a system for managing large-scale National Health Projects
    through the population's mobile phone technology. This allows
    monitoring of patients' compliance to their treatment programs, data
    capture to assist caregivers, diagnostic and analysis, automated
    coaching system, history of treatment and reminders to patients of
    medical appointments. </p>
    <p>The
    software's interaction with the patient gives the Health
    Authority/Medical Association an opportunity to manage specific
    diseases that they have chosen to target.</p>
    <h2>Clinical Trials</h2>
    <p>Our software provides detailed monitoring of patients' compliance to a
    specific treatment program through their mobile phone/PDA.</p>
    <p>This
    allows pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to carry out
    clinical trials on our technology in real time, replacing the
    standard CRF paper questionnaire.</p>
